					As you may know, <a target="_blank" href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/63227/~/announcement-of-discontinuation-of-online-services-for-nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u">Nintendo has announced</a> that online services for the Nintendo 3DS, 2DS and Wii U family of systems
					are shutting down in April.
				</p>
				<p>
					All online communication services, including the distribution of <span class="blue">SpotPass</span> data will be discontinued on <span class="yellow">April 8th, 2024, at 4pm PDT</span>. As a result, features using SpotPass in many titles will stop working once this change has taken effect.
				</p>
				<p>
					3DS/2DS and Wii U systems store a local database of titles for which you have recently received SpotPass data. This database can be used to check for the URLs it uses to download the SpotPass content.
				</p>
				<p>
					By dumping this database from your system(s), you can help <span class="bold">Pretendo</span> in preserving SpotPass content, ensuring that SpotPass features in these titles can be used long after Nintendo has pulled the plug on the service. <span class="bold">Database dumps do not contain any personally identifiable information.</span>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="main-block">
				<p>Popular 3DS titles using SpotPass features include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="blue">StreetPass Mii Plaza</span>: SpotPass was used to distribute special Miis (often of Nintendo employees) and puzzle pieces for the Puzzle Swap minigame. Without SpotPass, Puzzle Swap would normally not receive new puzzles.</li>
					<li><span class="blue">Mario Kart 7</span>: SpotPass was used to receive ghost data from other players and Nintendo.</li>
					<li><span class="blue">New Super Mario Bros. 2</span>: SpotPass was used to receive a certain system message allowing the installation of DLC.</li>
					<li><span class="blue">Tomodachi Life</span>: SpotPass was used to distribute special outfits.</li>
					<li><span class="blue">Swapnote</span> and <span class="blue">Swapdoodle</span>: SpotPass was used for sending and receiving notes (including notes from Nintendo).</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The way you dump the database depends on your system firmware version and whether or not you have CFW (custom firmware) installed.</p>
